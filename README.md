This repository contains a collection of scripts designed to record the player's name and score on a leaderboard **without** requiring email input. 
It also displays the top 10 players of the game in real-time.

## Project Objective:
_The primary aim of this project is to create and customize leaderboards, integrate them with leveling systems, achievements, triggers, and more. 
This leaderboard is connected to a player's unique identifier in **LootLocker**, which can be either a First Party ID or a Public UID._
