## Repository Description:
This repository contains a collection of scripts designed to record the player's name and score on a leaderboard **without** requiring email input. 
It also displays the top 10 players of the game in real-time.

## Project Objective:
_The primary aim of this project is to create and customize leaderboards, integrate them with leveling systems, achievements, triggers, and more. 
This leaderboard is connected to a player's unique identifier in **LootLocker**, which can be either a First Party ID or a Public UID._

### What is LootLocker?
**_LootLocker_** is a plug-and-play, cross-platform backend solution that empowers developers to build, launch, and operate their games effectively. It provides a wide range of tools to enhance our games and deliver the best possible experience to players.
